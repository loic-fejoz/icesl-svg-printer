IceSL SVG Printer
=================

Description
-----------

A special 3D "printer" configuration for [IceSL](http://www.loria.fr/~slefebvr/icesl/) that generates SVG instead of GCode.

This is an experimental use of IceSL as a 3D viewer and paths generator for laser engraver that cannot handle GCode as input.

NB: This project is not affiliated to IceSL even if the main author know its authors in person.

Usage
-----

1. Select the printer in the left menu.
2. Optionnaly `load_material_shader('first-layer-brush-1.sh')` to keep only the first layer (and adapt the cutting level in it). 
3. Slice your model.
4. `sed -r "s/^;\\s*\(.*\)\\s*$//g" <your filename>.gcode > <your filename>.svg`.
5. Inspect the result (with Inkscape for instance).

Installation
------------

1. `cd <your IceSL path>/gcode`
2. `git clone git@github.com:loic-fejoz/icesl-svg-printer.git`
